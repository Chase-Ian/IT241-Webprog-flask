# 🏇 Tracen Academy: Race Eligibility & Grading System

A specialized "System of Record" designed for **Tracen Academy**. This platform allows faculty members to record trainee performance and automatically determines race tier eligibility (G1, G2, G3, or OP) based on real-time academic standings.

## 📖 Project Overview
This system bridges the gap between classroom performance and the racetrack. Faculty members input grades, and the system utilizes a **Database View** to derive qualifications without manual calculation.

### **Core Business Rules**
* **Grading Scale:** 1.00 (Minimum) to 5.00 (Maximum).
* **Automated Eligibility Logic:**
    * **G1 (Elite):** Grade 4.00 – 5.00
    * **G2:** Grade 3.50 – 3.99
    * **G3:** Grade 3.00 – 3.49
    * **OP (Open):** Grade 1.00 – 2.99
* **Faculty Scope:** Professors are restricted to managing grades only for students within their assigned sections via Row Level Security (RLS).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
* **Logic:** SQL Derived Views
* **Authentication:** Supabase Auth 
* **Security:** PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS)
